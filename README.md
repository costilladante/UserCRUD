## About

Playground project to manage users based in React.

## Notes

- If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

- Keep in mind: The order plays a role because a ruleset will extend or overwrite the previous ones. So do not overdo with configs and plugins. See good explanation on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46544082/it-this-the-correct-way-of-extending-eslint-rules#50370083
